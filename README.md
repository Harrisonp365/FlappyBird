# FlappyBird
This is one of the early games I developed. It is a flappy bird replica. It was built using C++ in the Qt framework and utilizing lots of their graphical interfaces that are available. I found using the Qt framework was easy to use due to their amazing documentation which is super easy to read and use. I tried to make the game look as close to the original as possible and also just as hardâ€¦ The speed of the bird does slowly increase yet I found this hard to make it as smooth and nice as I would have liked. 
I will add some images below of the starting screen and the game in play. 
If you would like to download and run the code yourself feel free to, I seemed to have some issues using the MSVC 64 bit compiler but had no isses using the minGW 64.  
To jump/fly you use a mouse click.
